{"name":"Ana Fidalgo","tagline":"Amazing front-end developer","body":"### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nI’m an active person who enjoys the outdoors and to see the world around me. Whenever I get the chance to travel, I always take the opportunity to capture those moments with my camera.\r\n\r\nI’ve always had a strong passion for all things Web, which led me to a degree in New Communication Technologies and the pursuit of a career in Web Development.\r\n\r\nRecently I discovered the amazing world of Video Editing – an area I had the opportunity to explore during my early professional career. Although not one of my main focus at my work, I definitely developed a liking in this area.\r\nIn short, if you’re looking for someone who can create awesome videos, develop amazing websites or take some great professional pictures, then your search is over.
